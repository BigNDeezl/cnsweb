TLRD; A repo utilized for training via webapp development

I'm teaching myself a lot of things.  
My intent is to create a personal web app for myself with flask and sqlalchemy.  
I'm going to develop it using a dev environment I setup in a docker container.
I intend to develop from multiple locations and on multiple systems.
Using github and git, I'll push and pull updates to the code to/from this repository using git CLI.
